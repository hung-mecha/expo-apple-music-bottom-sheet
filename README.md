# Expo Apple Music Bottom Sheet 🎶

A smooth and interactive Apple Music–style bottom sheet animation built with:

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev)
- [Reanimated v3](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/)
- [@gorhom/bottom-sheet](https://github.com/gorhom/react-native-bottom-sheet)

This replicates the behavior of the Apple Music mini-player expanding into a full player with animated transitions for content, image scaling, and background color.
